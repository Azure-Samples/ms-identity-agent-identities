# Microsoft Identity - Agent Identities Samples

This repository contains samples demonstrating how to use **Agent Identities** in Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Identity Web. Agent Identities enable AI agents to securely access downstream services using either autonomous (app-only) or user-delegated tokens.

## üì¶ Samples

### [.NET Customer Service Agent with Aspire](dotnet/CustomerServiceAgent/)
[![.NET 9](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-9.0-purple)](https://dot.net)
[![Aspire 9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Aspire-9.0-blue)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/)

A comprehensive sample showcasing how an AI agent orchestrates multiple downstream APIs using:
- **Autonomous Agent Identities** for read operations (Order & CRM APIs)
- **Agent User Identities** for write operations with user context (Shipping & Email APIs)
- **.NET Aspire** for distributed tracing, logging, and service orchestration
- **In-memory stores** for quick setup without external dependencies

**Perfect for:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 - 30-minute hands-on lab

## üéØ What are Agent Identities?

**Agent Identities** are a new capability in Microsoft Entra ID that enable AI agents to:

1. **Autonomous Agent Identity** - Acquire app-only tokens for operations that don't require user context (e.g., reading data)
2. **Agent User Identity** - Acquire tokens with user context for operations requiring user identity (e.g., writing data, sending emails)

This allows developers to build AI agents that can securely call downstream APIs with the appropriate level of authorization.

### Key Benefits
‚úÖ **Secure by design** - Tokens are validated by Microsoft Entra ID  
‚úÖ **Flexible authorization** - Mix app-only and user-delegated patterns  
‚úÖ **Audit trail** - All operations are logged with proper identity context  
‚úÖ **Works with existing APIs** - No changes needed to downstream services
